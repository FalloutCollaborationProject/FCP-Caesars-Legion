        <description>Unlike the NCR, the Legion couldn’t rely on a strong industrial centre to supply them with enough weapons and ammunition to supply their ever-growing army. [PAWN_nameDef] was a scavenger for the Legion, who’s main task was to scavenge pre-war buildings for weaponry. As the Legion generally was a rather low-tech faction, they favoured weapons that were easy to maintain and repair and rugged enough to keep their functionality in the hazardous wasteland.</description>

        <description>Some people join the Legion for survival. Some join for loyalty. [PAWN_nameDef] joined because [PAWN_pronoun] loves war. The Legion offered something that no other faction could, unlimited opportunities for battle, slaughter, and conquest. [PAWN_pronoun] fights not for Caesar, not for glory, but simply because it’s what [PAWN_pronoun] does best.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] has fought beside greatness. From the early days of [PAWN_possessive] service, [PAWN_pronoun] caught the attention of a powerful Centurion, serving as a personal enforcer, executioner, and right-hand warrior. In battle, [PAWN_nameDef] was the one sent to break the enemy’s resolve, to cut down officers, champions, and cowards alike. With [PAWN_possessive] Centurion now dead, [PAWN_pronoun] fights on, not just to honor the fallen, but to one day rise to that same position of power.</description>

        <description>Some battles end in an hour. Others last years. When Caesar ordered a campaign deep into NCR-controlled territory, [PAWN_nameDef] was among those sent on the grueling march. Months without resupply. Constant fighting. Watching entire centuries wiped out. [PAWN_pronoun] survived it all and returned to tell the tale, scarred, hardened, and more devoted than ever. Those who survived became Veterans, forged into warriors beyond pain or fear.</description>

        <description>The battle for Hoover Dam was a test, one that many Legionaries did not survive. But [PAWN_nameDef] was among the few who stood victorious, cutting through wave after wave of NCR defenders. Even when the battle turned against Caesar, [PAWN_pronoun] refused to flee, choosing to hold ground until the last possible moment. Now, [PAWN_pronoun] fights not just for conquest, but for revenge, to see the NCR shattered and Hoover Dam taken once and for all.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up under the New California Republic, believing in democracy, law, and order. But as the NCR spread, corruption and weakness spread with it. When the Legion came, [PAWN_pronoun] expected death. Instead, [PAWN_pronoun] was given a chance to serve something stronger than the crumbling NCR. Now, with a sword in hand, [PAWN_pronoun] fights against the very nation [PAWN_pronoun] once called home, convinced that Caesar’s way is the only way forward.</description>

Instead, [PAWN_pronoun] was given a choice: submit and fight for Caesar or be wiped away like the rest of [PAWN_possessive] people. With nothing left, [PAWN_pronoun] chose the Legion. At first, it was just survival. But as the years passed, [PAWN_pronoun] began to understand the Legion’s strength. The weak are burned away, and the strong endure. [PAWN_pronoun] will never be weak again.</description>

        <description>Early in [PAWN_possessive] life, [PAWN_nameDef] showed a great talent for hunting. These skills were fostered by the Legion, as food was scarce in the Legion camps and the hides of the beasts [PAWN_pronoun] slayed could be used to craft many useful goods like waterskins, tents and other necessities.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef]’s mother was a healer in the Legion. While the Legion did not have access to high-tech medicine due to their refusal to use modern technology, the Legion’s healers managed to cook up various poultices, ointments, and other herbal remedies. [PAWN_nameDef] learned a good deal about healing from [PAWN_possessive] mother.</description>

        <description>Like many other larger political entities, Caesar had his Legion mint coins adorned with his profile. [PAWN_nameDef] was born to a minter and enjoyed a relatively peaceful childhood, as the Legion left [PAWN_possessive] family be, due to the rarity of the skill provided by them.</description>
